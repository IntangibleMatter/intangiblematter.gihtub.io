      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re wondering what the title stands for, it&amp;rsquo;s Yet Another Update From Yet Another Internet Trans Girl, and this post is exactly what it says on the tin.&#xA;I have some posts about my previous gender questioning on this page, so it&amp;rsquo;s not anything new. But tl;dr for anyone who hasn&amp;rsquo;t read the previous posts: I&amp;rsquo;m gender questioning, fit a lot of tropes for transfems, spend a ton of time thinking about what it would be like to be a girl, wishing I was a girl, knowing that girls (especially trans ones) have a lot harder time moving through life than cis guys do, but still feeling like it would be easier, etc, etc, etc.</description>

      <description>So I watched Barbie with some friends, and it was really good! I loved the storytelling, the characters, the plot, and&amp;hellip; god dammit, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t expecting a Barbie movie to be the most unabashedly feminist work I&amp;rsquo;d ever seen.</description>

      <title>Eggs Like Russian Dolls</title>

      <description>So a while back I made a post about how my egg had cracked, and that I was, disappointingly, cis.&#xA;In retrospect, I now think that the egg had just cracked to reveal another egg. I just kind of default to being cis because it&amp;rsquo;s what i know, and because I feel uncomfortable with uncertainty, especially about core parts of myself. I don&amp;rsquo;t think any truly cis person could say the phrase &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m cis in the way that I&amp;rsquo;d do lines of estrogen&amp;rdquo; with a straight face.</description>

      <description>A while back I made a post about my gender and my experience in questioning. I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce that my egg has recently cracked! And&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m not trans.&#xA;Disappointing, right? I know, I was disappointed too. But it&amp;rsquo;s fine to not be a member of a group with so many cool members oh my god it&amp;rsquo;s statistically anomalous how many cool trans people there are. What I am, however, is someone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t strongly identify with the societal construct of masculinity.</description>

      <title>Eggs and Gender</title>

      <description>Gender is weird.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s such a social construct yet our society has been built on it on such a fundamental level that to most it&amp;rsquo;s a huge deal for most people to even consider changing from the gender they&amp;rsquo;ve been assigned. It&amp;rsquo;s an even bigger deal because of all the genocidal language that&amp;rsquo;s getting thrown around by neofascists about trans people as of late.&#xA;Which, of course, means it&amp;rsquo;s a great time to resume the questioning I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing on and off for the last 5 years!</description>
