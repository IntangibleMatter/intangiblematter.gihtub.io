      <description>As 2023 comes to a close, everyone is writing their lists of The Top 10 Games of 2023, or The Best Albums of the Year or whatever other miscellaneous things you can make lists of. So I decided to write something about the media I enjoyed this year, if nothing else for the sake of the Permanent Record of the Internetâ„¢ (and myself) to look back upon. I could separate this by the type of media, order it by my favourite, but I think it&amp;rsquo;ll be easiest if I just order by when I first experienced them.</description>
