      <description>In August of this year I started reading one of the most infamous webcomics, parts of internet culture, and just general clusterfucks out there. Which is to say that I started reading Homestuck.&#xA;Homestuck, for those who don&amp;rsquo;t know, is/was a webcomic about four kids who play a game that results in the end of the world, and their efforts to create a new one. That&amp;rsquo;s the short version of it, and it also mentions nothing of the numerous flashes, incredible music, odd spin-offs and sidequests, its nature as a borderline cult, much to the distress of the creator, and all of the other chaos.</description>
