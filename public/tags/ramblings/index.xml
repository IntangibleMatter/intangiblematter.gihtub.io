      <description>For the past few months I&amp;rsquo;ve had my blog separated into two different pages: /posts/ and /personal/. Posts was where my more general, public-friendly stuff would go, and personal is my archive for all my personal ramblings. But you know what, fuck it. It&amp;rsquo;s all me. Every post on here is me, whether it&amp;rsquo;s a personal rambling or it&amp;rsquo;s a guide on how to do something in tech. It&amp;rsquo;s all me.</description>

      <description>So I watched Barbie with some friends, and it was really good! I loved the storytelling, the characters, the plot, and&amp;hellip; god dammit, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t expecting a Barbie movie to be the most unabashedly feminist work I&amp;rsquo;d ever seen.</description>

      <title>Don Hertzfeldt, Hangar, and the Desire to Be Human</title>

      <description>So if you&amp;rsquo;ve spent any amount of time talking to me (or, more accurately, listening to me talk,) you&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard me talk about Don Hertzfeldt. Don Hertzfeldt is a self-described Oscar-losing filmmaker. He makes animated films starring stick figures, dry narration, and some of the most beautiful stories I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen. His debut feature, It&amp;rsquo;s Such A Beautiful Day, is an hour-long attack on the senses, featuring filmmaking techniques taken to their limits.</description>

      <description>If you held me against a wall with a gun to my head asking me what my favourite song was, I&amp;rsquo;d probably have a fatal panic attack.&#xA;If I somehow managed to respond, however, I would probably say with very little hesitation that the answer is Hangar by 8485. It&amp;rsquo;s a song that means a lot to me, and that I&amp;rsquo;ve listened to more times than any other song in my music library.</description>

      <title>The Rare Moments You Feel Like You&#39;re Real</title>

      <description>Here&amp;#39;s a song that I like. Might be good to listen to with this post. Idk.&#xA;You know how some people feel like they&amp;rsquo;re the only real person in the world?&#xA;I have the opposite problem.&#xA;To some degree.&#xA;Society paints a very strong picture in our minds of what a &amp;ldquo;teenager&amp;rdquo; is supposed to do. And I very rarely find myself meeting those expectations. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s because of my anxiety, depression, or just general tendencies to isolate myself socially (lockdown was a bit of a dream come true), I tend to find myself working on my computer, browsing the internet, and just being alone with my (admittedly distressing) thoughts.</description>

      <title>My First Fullindie Meetup</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2023/06/06/my-first-fullindie-meetup/</link>

      <description>So&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m writing this on the ferry ride home from my very first FullIndie meetup! I basically got on a bus right after school to get down to the ferry, then I went into Vancouer and&amp;hellip; ate food?&#xA;Also all of this was with my friend River. They&amp;rsquo;re cool. Check them out. Without whom I probably would&amp;rsquo;ve been having an anxiety attack for the whole trip so&amp;hellip; thanks, Riv!&#xA;After we ate, we went down to the Skytrain and went down to the place where the meetup was happening.</description>

      <title>Impostor Syndrome, Adhd, and Burgers</title>

      <description>So this is just a short little update. At the time of writing this, I&amp;rsquo;m currently waiting for a burger because I have nothing better to do in the time between now and when I go and talk to a whole bunch of mental health people to find out if my mental illness is disruptive enough to the system to give me support for something that I&amp;rsquo;ve recently realized has been making my whole life harder than it has to be.</description>

      <title>It&#39;s a Defence Mechanism</title>

      <description>I can be a bit of a dick sometimes, and I&amp;rsquo;m well aware. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be, I frequently don&amp;rsquo;t even mean to be, but, almost as a reflex, I am. I exist almost in a state of perpetual vulnerability.</description>

      <title>Would It Kill Them to Declare a Snow Day</title>

      <description>It is 7:15 am right now. The snow on the road outside my house is currently about 15cm deep at least and shows no signs of slowing down. I wake up, look out my window and assume they&amp;rsquo;ve declared a snow day. Checking my school&amp;rsquo;s app, however, tells me a different story.&#xA;Dear [my school district] Learning Community: All [my school district] schools will have a DELAYED START today, Tuesday, February 28, 2023, due to inclement weather.</description>

      <title>Mirrors</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2023/02/23/mirrors/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/2023/02/23/mirrors/</guid>
      <description>I feel like the people we get along best with are always, to some degree, mirrors of ourselves. My closest friends all mirror some aspect of myself, and I some aspect of them. The more you mirror, the more likely you are to be friends.&#xA;A lot of my friends don&amp;rsquo;t have much in common, aside from being generally smart in various ways, and always having something or another that they can talk your ear off about.</description>
