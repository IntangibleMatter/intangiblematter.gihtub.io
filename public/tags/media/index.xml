      <description>In August of this year I started reading one of the most infamous webcomics, parts of internet culture, and just general clusterfucks out there. Which is to say that I started reading Homestuck.&#xA;Homestuck, for those who don&amp;rsquo;t know, is/was a webcomic about four kids who play a game that results in the end of the world, and their efforts to create a new one. That&amp;rsquo;s the short version of it, and it also mentions nothing of the numerous flashes, incredible music, odd spin-offs and sidequests, its nature as a borderline cult, much to the distress of the creator, and all of the other chaos.</description>

      <description>Wallsocket, the new album released by underscores on September 22nd, 2023, has quickly and easily risen to be my album of the year. After a lead up of a variety of singles being released, almost all of which I greatly enjoyed, the album released with a great variety of genres, tones, themes, and characters, all while feeling like a very cohesive work.&#xA;Cops and Robbers pass&#xA;Locals (Girls like us) pass</description>

      <description>So I watched Barbie with some friends, and it was really good! I loved the storytelling, the characters, the plot, and&amp;hellip; god dammit, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t expecting a Barbie movie to be the most unabashedly feminist work I&amp;rsquo;d ever seen.</description>

      <description>So if you&amp;rsquo;ve spent any amount of time talking to me (or, more accurately, listening to me talk,) you&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard me talk about Don Hertzfeldt. Don Hertzfeldt is a self-described Oscar-losing filmmaker. He makes animated films starring stick figures, dry narration, and some of the most beautiful stories I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen. His debut feature, It&amp;rsquo;s Such A Beautiful Day, is an hour-long attack on the senses, featuring filmmaking techniques taken to their limits.</description>

      <description>My music taste changes constantly. I had a long time where I mostly listened to video game music, then a good few months where I mostly listened to electro. (Thanks, Just Shapes and Beats!) Recently, though, I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to hyperpop. For those of you who don&amp;rsquo;t know, hyperpop is a musical genre which can be loosely defined as a type of music that borrows strongly from pop for its layout, early 2000s internet for its musical aesthetics, and pretty much whatever the hell the artist feels like for the lyrics.</description>

      <title>Katana ZERO Is a Masterpiece</title>

      <description>Katana ZERO, for those of you who don&amp;rsquo;t know, is a 2019 video game created by Justin Standard (aka Askiisoft) and a few others. It features difficult side-scrolling action, tight combat, an amazing soundtrack, beautiful pixel art, and one of my favourite stories of the past decade. While I could rave about it for hours, I&amp;rsquo;ll do my best to keep this article finite.&#xA;Also, in case it wasn&amp;rsquo;t obvious, there will be MAJOR SPOILERS for Katana ZERO!</description>

      <title>I&#39;m Fine: a Short Film</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/2023/05/05/im-fine-a-short-film/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Fine is a short film that I wrote, recorded, and filmed almost entirely by myself in late April of 2023 for my high school&amp;rsquo;s film fest. I&amp;rsquo;ve had ideas for various projects about my mental health for a few years now. This is the first project of this vein that I&amp;rsquo;ve completed, and it almost definitely won&amp;rsquo;t be the last. This film features me and three representations of various aspects of my mental health while anxiety screams over me, depression mopes while resting its head on the heater, and my own expectations of myself frantically justify why they exist by the mirror.</description>

      <title>A Brief Hantiplad About Everything Everywhere All At Once</title>

      <description>So I finally got to watch that movie everyone was talking about last year. It&amp;rsquo;s honestly even better than everyone says. The effects were amazing, the writing was fantastic, and the actors were all&amp;hellip; *chef&amp;rsquo;s kiss*.&#xA;Our deadpan-hyper chaotic-evil queen.&#xA;My favourite character was easily Jobu Tupekai. She&amp;rsquo;s honestly everything I aspire to be. A cool, nihilistic, reality warping, amazing looking young adult who created an object that can destroy the most powerful people somewhat out of boredom.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/2023/03/05/wandersong-and-oddballism/</guid>
      <description>Wandersong is a very special game. Ask almost anyone who&amp;rsquo;s played it, and you&amp;rsquo;ll find them at the very least agreeing enthusiastically, and more than likely raving about some moment in the game or another. In addition to this, the creator says there&amp;rsquo;s almost as many pieces of fanart as copies of the game sold. Which is, to put it lightly, incredible. But I&amp;rsquo;m not here today to talk about how beloved this game is.</description>

      <description>Daria, for those of you who don&amp;rsquo;t know, is a late-90s tv show which aired on MTV. It is also the single most accurate depiction of my high school experience that I have seen.</description>

      <description>In case you couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell by the fact that I make games and have spent the majority of the money I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten as a teenager on Steam gift cards, I&amp;rsquo;m a bit of a fan of the medium of video games.&#xA;The Beginner&amp;rsquo;s Guide Everybody feels like shit sometimes.&#xA;Everybody makes mistakes.&#xA;Not everybody makes a game which conveys these feelings so effectively and in a way that feels so painfully accurate to how it feels to have hurt somebody in a way you can&amp;rsquo;t take back.</description>

      <description>Don Hertzfeldt, if you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard of him, is a filmmaker with a simple yet distinct art style. His works It&amp;rsquo;s Such a Beautiful Day and the World of Tomorrow series are some of the most</description>
