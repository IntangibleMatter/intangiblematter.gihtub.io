      <description>Wandersong is a very special game. Ask almost anyone who&amp;rsquo;s played it, and you&amp;rsquo;ll find them at the very least agreeing enthusiastically, and more than likely raving about some moment in the game or another. In addition to this, the creator says there&amp;rsquo;s almost as many pieces of fanart as copies of the game sold. Which is, to put it lightly, incredible. But I&amp;rsquo;m not here today to talk about how beloved this game is.</description>
