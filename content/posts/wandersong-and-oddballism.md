Wandersong is a very special game. Ask almost anyone who's played it, and you'll find them at the very least agreeing enthusiastically,
and more than likely raving about some moment in the game or another. In addition to this,
[the creator says there's almost as much fanart as sold copies of the game.](https://medium.com/@banovg/reflecting-on-wandersong-f2891fec09aa)
Which is, to put it lightly, incredible. But I'm not here today to talk about how beloved this game is. What I'm here to talk about is Wandersong and delighting in being an oddball.

Wandersong is a game that came into my life at exactly the right time. I first heard of it while watching a [video essay](https://youtu.be/cYnylXvk65s)
around June of 2020. It being the Steam Summer sale, I bought it, played it, and almost immediately had a new favourite game. I was in 8th grade when I
started playing Wandersong, and the final third of that grade had been taken from me by the COVID-19 pandemic.

I live in a small town in Canada, so for me eight grade was my first year of high school. At the beginning of it, I was a bright-eyed optimist who
couldn't for the life of him read social signals; and by the end of that year I found out that a lot of people I thought were my friends hated me, and
that maybe my anxiety had a point sometimes. March of 2020 was a turning point for everyone. It locked everyone into their homes, forced us all to be
accountable for how our actions would affect others, and gave us all a sense of dread about the world. This is when I really started to do two things:

1) Isolate myself socially.
2) Start making video games.

Wandersong, incredible game that it is, helped me with both. 

In eighth grade I was a bright-eyed optimist. I said hello to everybody I would pass, and thought of almost anybody who would engage with me in a
positive way as a friend. The sad truth that I've come to know over the years is that not everyone will be your friend, and if you're an overly
friendly know-it-all some people who you thought of as friends will hate you.
