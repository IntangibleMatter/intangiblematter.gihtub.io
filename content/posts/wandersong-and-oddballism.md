Wandersong is a very special game. Ask almost anyone who's played it, and you'll find them at the very least agreeing enthusiastically,
and more than likely raving about some moment in the game or another. In addition to this,
[the creator says there's almost as many pieces of fanart as copies of the game sold.](https://medium.com/@banovg/reflecting-on-wandersong-f2891fec09aa#7fcb)
Which is, to put it lightly, incredible. But I'm not here today to talk about how beloved this game is. What I'm here to talk about is Wandersong and
delighting in being an oddball.

Wandersong is a game that came into my life at exactly the right time. I first heard of it while watching a [video essay](https://youtu.be/cYnylXvk65s)
around June of 2020. It being the Steam Summer sale, I bought it, played it, and almost immediately had a new favourite game. I was in 8th grade when I
started playing Wandersong, and the final third of that grade had been taken from me by the COVID-19 pandemic.

I live in a small town in Canada, so for me eight grade was my first year of high school. At the beginning of it, I was a bright-eyed optimist who
couldn't for the life of him read social signals; and by the end of that year I found out that a lot of people I thought were my friends hated me, and
that maybe my anxiety had a point sometimes. March of 2020 was a turning point for everyone. It locked everyone into their homes, forced us all to be
accountable for how our actions would affect others, and gave us all a sense of dread about the world. This is when I really started to do two things:

1) Isolate myself socially.
2) Start making video games.

Wandersong, incredible game that it is, helped me with both.

If you want to know who I was from when I was little, take a look at the bard and how they interact with the world. That seemingly endless, eternal optimism is
very similar to how I behaved. Hardships still existed, but I didn't really let things phase me (at least not openly.) Wandersong was the first time I
had gotten to see a realistic reflection of that in anything. A character who was not only odd, exceptional, and kind, but one who *delighted* in being so.
It's something that almost every piece of media that targets kids encourages, yet it almost always feels disingenuous. Wandersong sets this example
unapologetically. You can feel the oddballism and all the pride and nervousness that comes with that oozing through every inch of the game.

I guess I should probably define oddballism if you can't quite pick out the exact meaning.
