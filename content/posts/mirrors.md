I feel like the people we get along best with are always, to some degree, mirrors of ourself. 
My closest friends all mirror some aspect of myself, and I some aspect of them. The more you mirror, the more likely you are to be friends.

A lot of my friends don't have mmuch in common, aside from being generally smart in various ways, and always having something or another that they can talk your ear off about.

But when friendships end or people get hurt, the mirror breaks. Sometimes it cracks, sometimes it shatters. It almost always hurts, though.
