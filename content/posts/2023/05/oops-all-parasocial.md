So... it's not exactly a secret that I've struggled to make friendships in
life. I've never been good at reading social signals, I'm always direct about
things that most people are at least *somewhat* awkward about, and I've always
had a lot of niche intrests that most people I know knew little to nothing
about. On top of that, I have social anxiety! Which for me means that
*obviously* someone not replying for a while means that I made a social misstep
that I didn't notice and not that they're busy or something.

Combine all of these together and you get a kid who struggles to make
real life connections, but *thrives* on the internet. Unfortunately, I've
never made any internet friends (so far,) so instead I've become someone who
has a lot of the oft-maligned *parasocial relationships*.

A parasocial relationship, for those of you who don't know, is a
one-directional relationship between someone who creates content and someone
who consumes that content. An example of this might be people who trust Tucker
Carlson on everything because he talks in a way that speaks to them and feels
personal, so people begin to trust him, form relationships with him, and value
what he values. All of this is, of course, one-sided. He has no idea anyone in
his audience exists in particular, and he's just there to make some money and
spread some hate.

Parasocial relationships, despite all of their downfalls, have gotten me
through a lot of my adolescent years.
