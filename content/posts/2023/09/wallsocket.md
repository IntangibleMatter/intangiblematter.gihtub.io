Wallsocket, the new album released by *underscores* on September 22<sup>nd</sup>,
2023, has quickly and easily risen to be my album of the year. After a lead up
of a variety of singles being released, almost all of which I *greatly* enjoyed,
the album released with a great variety of genres, tones, themes, and characters,
all while feeling like a very cohesive work.
