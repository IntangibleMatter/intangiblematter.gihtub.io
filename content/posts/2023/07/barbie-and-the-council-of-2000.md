So I watched Barbie with [some friends,]({{< ref "posts/2023/06/the-rare-moments-you-feel-like-youre-real.md" >}})
and it was really good! I loved the storytelling, the characters, the plot,
and... god dammit, I wasn't expecting a *Barbie* movie to be the most
unabashedly feminist work I'd ever seen.
