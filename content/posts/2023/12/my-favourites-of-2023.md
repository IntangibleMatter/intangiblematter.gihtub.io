As 2023 comes to a close, everyone is writing their lists of
*The Top 10 Games of 2023*, or *The Best Albums of the Year* or whatever other
miscellaneous things you can make lists of. So I decided to write something
about the media I enjoyed this year, if nothing else for the sake of the
Permanent Record of the Internetâ„¢ (and myself) to look back upon. I could
separate this by the type of media, order it by my favourite, but I think it'll
be easiest if I just order by when I first experienced them.

## Everything Everywhere All At Once

Yeah, I know, it came out in 2022, but I didn't see it until *this year*, okay?
When it finally hit the theatres near me I had COVID, and I just hadn't gotten
around to it until I watched it with my Aunt over Spring Break. I loved it enough
to [write a whole post about it]({{< ref "/posts/2023/04/a-brief-rant-about-everything-everywhere.md" >}})
