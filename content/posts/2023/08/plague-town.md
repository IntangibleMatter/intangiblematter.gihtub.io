Plague Town by 8485 is an incredibly special album to me.

While I started out listening to only one or two songs from it, over the next
year it always had a song that was *exactly* what I needed when I needed it,
and I slowly added all five songs on the EP to my rotation. From the longing,
echoing synths of *Hangar* to the lying on the floor breakup song *Southview*,
there was always something special in this album for me.

The first one I remember clicking with was Hangar. A beautiful song which I
doubt I will ever stop talking about. To some degree I relate to it, and to
another I long to understand it. It discusses taking a moment to try to escape
the mundanity of suburbam life with a friend of yours. Not having anywhere you
want to go, just wanting to go for a drive with someone you care about, and
just wanting to not be *here.* There have been a great many late nights where I
listen to this song, crying on the floor or in bed, thinking of how
[*isolated* I tend to make myself as a teenager.]({{< ref "/content/posts/2023/06/the-rare-moments-you-feel-like-youre-real.md" >}})
Hangar always makes me feel less alone, because it allows me to *perceive* the
feelings in someone else's head so viscerally. If I had to pick a single song
as my faourite, it'd probably be this one.

Purgatory is the second one I remember finding interesting, though funnily
enough it's now the song on the album that I tend to skip over the most.
It's a very spacy song,

Southview is a breakup song. I first really found it and *clicked* with it a
few days before my own major high school breakup. It was also the only song
during the breakup that actually... seemed to be feeling what I felt. That
made it special to start with, but its wide open intrumentation centred aroung
an electric guitar playing rather mellowly elevates it to another level. The
poetry of the words combined with how raw the feeling was makes it just...
extra special to me.

> I hate everything I loved six months back\
> Please don’t look at me, I’m sick and so sad\
> I can breathe as long as you don’t know that

> You don’t really ask how I am so it’s easy\
> I don’t really care if you don’t want to see me\
> Honestly I’m finding your face hard to look at\
> I don’t wanna try ‘cause I’m tired of the pushback

> Things can feel exactly right and go bad\
> I need to remember, need to know that\
> I can’t move I’m so scared to be shown it\
> Again and again\
> I don’t have any friends from when I was a kid and I’m so glad

I've *never* been religious, but that doesn't mean I can't appreciate *Pure*
for what it is.
