This was a triumph!

I'm making a note here: huge success.

It's hard to overstate my satisfaction

Aperture science

We do what we must because we can

For the good of all of us

Except the ones who are dead

But there's no sense crying over every mistake

You just keep on trying 'til you run out of cake

And the science gets done

And you make a neat gun

For the people who are still alive
