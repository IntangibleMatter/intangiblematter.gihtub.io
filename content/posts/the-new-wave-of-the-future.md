My music taste changes constantly. I had a long time where I mostly listened to
video game music, then a good few months where I mostly listened to electro.
(Thanks, Just Shapes and Beats!) Recently, though, I've been listening to 
hyperpop. For those of you who don't know, hyperpop is a musical genre which
can be loosely defined as a type of music that borrows strongly from pop for 
its layout, early 2000s internet for its musical aesthetics, and pretty much
whatever the hell the artist feels like for the lyrics.

I first discovered hyperpop when I heard of the album
[*fishmonger* by underscores](#underscores) in a video by Alpo Media where he 
reviewed his subscriber's favourite albums. I believe he discusses it at about 
7:13. I was in need of some new music at the time, and decided to check it out 
because... weird is fun! I was *not* disappointed and ended up with one of my 
most listened to albums of 2022.

The genre is largely characterized by the following traits, though they can 
all be taken or left as the artist desires.
- Extreme use of autotune
- Bright synths
- Blown out instruments
- Glitchcore inspirations
- Frequent use of samples

The inclusion of any of the components and their use is entirely up to the 
artist, and hyperpop music will frequently vary dramatically from artist to 
artist.

## 8485

8485 is the second artist of this genre who I got into, and the first one that
caused me to identify "hyperpop" as something that I liked. 8485 is an artist
who is based somewhere in Ontario. Her music frequently explores themes of
directionlessness, living in the present, and wanting to escape suburbia. Her 
song *Hangar* is a song that I've loved for a while now, and I've spent many a 
day where I will simply have the drawn out, retroesque synths and longing
vocals looping in my head.

I feel like *Hangar* in particular, at least to me, speaks to many teenager's 
feelings of wanting to escape their hometown, especially suburban or rural
areas. Interestingly, the original title of this post was
*8485 and the Idealization of a False Present*, and I was planning to talk
about how her music makes me feel, even if for a moment, like what our societal
idea of a "real teenager" is. I've never been someone who particularly seeks
out social situations or adventure. On the contrary, I rather tend to avoid
them. 

I cannot think of any song that makes me feel more like this (see below image)
