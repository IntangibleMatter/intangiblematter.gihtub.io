My music taste changes constantly. I had a long time where I mostly listened to
video game music, then a good few months where I mostly listened to electro.
(Thanks, Just Shapes and Beats!) Recently, though, I've been listening to 
hyperpop. For those of you who don't know, hyperpop is a musical genre which
can be loosely defined as a type of music that borrows strongly from pop for 
its layout, early 2000s internet for its musical aesthetics, and pretty much
whatever the hell the artist feels like for the lyrics.

I first discovered hyperpop when I heard of the album
[*fishmonger* by underscores](#underscores) in a 
[video by Alpo Media](https://youtu.be/v9JWUUb8sQw?t=433) where he 
reviewed his subscriber's favourite albums. I believe he discusses it at about 
7:13. I was in need of some new music at the time, and decided to check it out 
because... weird is fun! I was *not* disappointed and ended up with one of my 
most listened to albums of 2022.

The genre is largely characterized by the following traits, though they can 
all be taken or left as the artist desires.
- Extreme use of autotune
- Bright synths
- Blown out instruments
- Glitchcore inspirations
- Frequent use of samples

The inclusion of any of the components and their use is entirely up to the 
artist, and hyperpop music will frequently vary dramatically from artist to 
artist.

## 8485

8485 is the second artist of this genre who I got into, and the first one that
caused me to identify "hyperpop" as something that I liked. 8485 is an artist
who is based somewhere in Ontario. Her music frequently explores themes of
directionlessness, living in the present, and wanting to escape suburbia. Her 
song *Hangar* is a song that I've loved for a while now, and I've spent many a 
day where I will simply have the drawn out, retroesque synths and longing
vocals looping in my head.

### Hangar

{{< youtube 3TsrJ9kPU3Q >}}
**Just want to note: This video also covers about the first minute of**
__*Purgatory* at the end of it.__

I feel like *Hangar* in particular, at least to me, speaks to many teenager's 
feelings of wanting to escape their hometown, especially suburban or rural
areas. Interestingly, the original title of this post was
*8485 and the Idealization of a False Present*, and I was planning to talk
about how her music makes me feel, even if for a moment, like what our societal
idea of a "real teenager" is. I've never been someone who particularly seeks
out social situations or adventure. On the contrary, I rather tend to avoid
them. This song gives me a brief escape from my lonerish tendencies (something
I continue to struggle with) and, for lack of a better term, maladaptive
daydream myself a world where I can let go of my cares for a minute. Where I 
can jump into a friend's car and escape it all for a moment. But for the 
meantime I continue to imagine a world where these words ring true for me,
and not just for some ideal other self I wish I had.

I feel that the final bridge sums the song's core up best with its lyrics:

> But I can't bring myself to\
> Hate me for wanting a break\
> I'll still be here in 5 years\
> Where I made every mistake\
> Sixteen trying to disappear\
> For one week and a half\
> You know it's all an act\
> 'Cause there's still a lot I haven't put into words yet

Ultimately, my mental state while just zoning out to this song can be summed up
in the following image:

### 1:15 

{{< youtube X6SCBvllfCA >}}

I have sung along to this song while miming out a little routine to the lyrics
many more times than I care to admit. It's not even that it's a song that I 
relate to! It's again similar to *Hangar* in being such a perfect encapsulation
of a feeling I wish I could relate to. Don't we all want to be an anime girl 
with a crush sometimes? Right? Not just me?

Well whichever way, this song's wonderful, upbeat feeling, extremely bright 
synths, and lyrics which I only know to describe as somewhat tsundere, are a 
wonderful little 2 minutes of music which continues on with 8485's incredible
ability to channel feelings into a little piece of music that almost anyone
can relate to, whether or not they've felt those things themselves.


### More to check out

I honestly haven't heard and 8485 song that I haven't liked. To be fair I also
haven't heard many 8485 songs. Whichever way, here are the ones I'd recommend
giving a listen off the top of my head.

(This is pretty much just a list of all the songs on *Plague Town* excluding 
*Hangar* because I gave that one its own section)

***Purgatory*** - A great little song to zone out to which seems to me to be 
another one of 8485's songs about relationships and/or suburbia.

***Seer*** - A song with extremely high vocals, and some sort of longing for
someone in what I can only assume is a romantic manner.

***Pure*** - Apparently this song is about a desire to be like christ, but as 
a lifelong athiest I can't really relate to that, so to me it's just a nice
little synthy song with some sort of longing lyrics.

***Southview*** - God I adore this breakup song. It does such a good job at 
capturing that feeling post-breakup when you don't know exactly what's going on 
and you're both giving each other space. This was one of my most listened to 
songs during my Big High School Breakupâ„¢.

tl;dr: Go listen to *Plague Town* if you like synthwave music and good singing
paired with great lyrics. Even if you don't still give it a listen! It's a 15 
minute long EP so you don't really have much to lose.

## 100 gecs

I'm writing this section as I'm riding the ferry home from the 100 gecs concert
in Vancouver! Or at least, I'm writing this sentence and the previous one
while on the way home. I'm eating poutine so I'm not gonna write a whole
section right now.

Alright, I finished my poutine and I've got a bit of time left before the 
ferry docks. 

100 gecs is probably the most famous artist that is definitively hyperpop in 
the world right now. Their first big hit, Money Machine, was a bit of a meme 
when it came out, but I didn't get into them until just after they released
their second album, *10000 gecs*, where most of my favourite songs of theirs 
are from. Approximately two weeks after hearing it, the opening song on the 
album, *Dumbest Girl Alive*, is my 16th most-listened to song so far this year.
I expect it to rise farther, and then probably fall a little when I get 
obsessed with another song sometime later this year.

I don't necessarily have as much to say about their individual songs as some of
the other artists in this list, but they still have some great songs which you should check out!

### 10000 gecs

I know what you're thinking. Isn't this the newer album? Why did you put this 
one first? Well the answer is that I put it first because I like it better. It 
has most of my favourite songs of theirs on it, and it's also just really
consistently *good*. Lemme list a few standout songs from the album.

#### Dumbest Girl Alive

{{< youtube oXrbMDww9ss >}}

God this one is a bop. It's the opening song on the album, and I don't know if 
there's a better way to open an album than by playing the **THX** sound effect.
The lyrics are amazing, stupid, and resonant in typical gec fashion, and are 
reportedly somewhat about transitioning. (The line "I did science on my face"
reportedly being a referrence to Facial Feminization Surgery, as an example.)

> If you think I'm stupid now,\
> You should see me when I'm high\
> And I'm smarter than I look,\
> I'm the dumbest girl alive

Like, *come on!* That's a fun song. Give it a listen. Please.

#### 757

Fun little song with a solid beat. Great to bob your head to, and a chorus
which is as catchy as any by this band which is a master of hooks.

> 757, yeah I'll never go to heaven\
> I've been smokin' since eleven\
> Told the devil he's a lemon, yeah

#### Hollywood Baby.

If you like guitar, give this one a check! It's got a strong electric guitar
at the center of it, and the lyrics are a lot of fun. This song is one that 
really gets you pumping easily, with the upbeat tempo, distorted synths, heavy
electric guitar and drums, it's one that definitely has a lot of mass appeal.

> Do you wanna party? Malibu Barbie\
> Are you gonna pack that shit up when it all comes tumbling down?\
> Do you wanna party? Malibu Barbie\
> Are you gonna pack that shit up when it all comes tumbling down?\
> So go pitch your fit, no one gives a shit\
> Better off if you just get over it

#### Frog on the Floor

Not a bad song, but honestly a skip for me. Just not my thing.

#### Doritos and Fritos

{{< youtube 2PWMiy4RysI >}}

Oh. Mygod. This song is such a fun, chaotic mess with noisy guitar, an 
*extremely* catchy bass riff, and an overall composition that feels like ska
got hammered and ended up having a one night stand with grunge while both were 
dressed in candy goth outfits. I know, it's weird and probably doesn't make 
sense, but this song is just... hard to describe! It's fun! It's silly! The 
lyrics don't really make sense and it feels like they just pulled random words 
out of a hat and then used an Ouija board to contact Dr. Seuss for advice on 
how to write lyrics. It's fun. It's pure fun and one of my favourite songs at 
the time of writing, and one of the first gec songs that I heard! Give it three 
listens. Nobody likes it the first time, but it is *such*. *a*. *bop*.

> Okay, I went to France to get some new pants (ooh!)\
> I went to Greece to get something to eat (ooh!)\
> He said "Shit, all we got's Doritos and Fritos"\
> I said "then give me all of those fucking Doritos and Fritos!"

#### Billy Knows Jamie

I gotta say, 2000s nu-metal is not something I was expecting to be brought
back, but it's not an unwelcome return! Especially from the masters of
genremashing. If you want something with that classic intense guitar/bass feel 
and the intense style of every angry 16 year old boy in 2002's favourite genre,
give this a listen! Not for everyone, but still good fun.

> Billy knows Jamie, Jamie got a gun\
> Jamie gonna kill me, think I need to run\
> Jamie goin' loco, Jamie off the juice\
> Jamie kinda scary when he lookin' at you, come on!

#### One Million Dollars

One million dollars!

> One million dollars!\
> One million dollars!\
> One million dollars!

#### The Most Wanted Person in the United States

Nice chill beat, lots of somewhat random sounds, and a buttload of catchy
hooks. Not much to say about this one aside from it being just a solid little 
song with fun, silly lyrics and a bunch of samples.

> Yeah, I'm a real killer\
> I just killed Bobby, and then I ate his dinner\
> Then I took his car, and I crashed it in the river\\
> Always been cold, I was born in the winter

#### MeMeMe

Seems to be about a disfunctional relationship or something. But you don't 
really notice that until a few listens in because of how intense the screaming
synths are, and the ska-style verse. Yet another one with great hooks, but that 
goes without saying for this band.

> I tried on yout lipstick, I thought I looked pretty\
> But you didn't care, no, 'cause you're always busy\
> And you're always busy, so you never hear me\
> So you'll never really know, know, know, know, know, know, know\
> Anything about me, me, me, me, me, me, me
