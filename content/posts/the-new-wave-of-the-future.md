My music taste changes constantly. I had a long time where I mostly listened to
video game music, then a good few months where I mostly listened to electro.
(Thanks, Just Shapes and Beats!) Recently, though, I've been listening to 
hyperpop. For those of you who don't know, hyperpop is a musical genre which
can be loosely defined as a type of music that borrows strongly from pop for 
its layout, early 2000s internet for its musical aesthetics, and pretty much
whatever the hell the artist feels like for the lyrics.

I first discovered hyperpop when I heard of the album
[*fishmonger* by underscores](#underscores) in a 
[video by Alpo Media](https://youtu.be/v9JWUUb8sQw?t=433) where he 
reviewed his subscriber's favourite albums. I believe he discusses it at about 
7:13. I was in need of some new music at the time, and decided to check it out 
because... weird is fun! I was *not* disappointed and ended up with one of my 
most listened to albums of 2022.

The genre is largely characterized by the following traits, though they can 
all be taken or left as the artist desires.
- Extreme use of autotune
- Bright synths
- Blown out instruments
- Glitchcore inspirations
- Frequent use of samples

The inclusion of any of the components and their use is entirely up to the 
artist, and hyperpop music will frequently vary dramatically from artist to 
artist.

## 8485

8485 is the second artist of this genre who I got into, and the first one that
caused me to identify "hyperpop" as something that I liked. 8485 is an artist
who is based somewhere in Ontario. Her music frequently explores themes of
directionlessness, living in the present, and wanting to escape suburbia. Her 
song *Hangar* is a song that I've loved for a while now, and I've spent many a 
day where I will simply have the drawn out, retroesque synths and longing
vocals looping in my head.

### Hangar

{{< youtube 3TsrJ9kPU3Q >}}
**Just want to note: This video also covers about the first minute of**
__*Purgatory* at the end of it.__

I feel like *Hangar* in particular, at least to me, speaks to many teenager's 
feelings of wanting to escape their hometown, especially suburban or rural
areas. Interestingly, the original title of this post was
*8485 and the Idealization of a False Present*, and I was planning to talk
about how her music makes me feel, even if for a moment, like what our societal
idea of a "real teenager" is. I've never been someone who particularly seeks
out social situations or adventure. On the contrary, I rather tend to avoid
them. This song gives me a brief escape from my lonerish tendencies (something
I continue to struggle with) and, for lack of a better term, maladaptive
daydream myself a world where I can let go of my cares for a minute. Where I 
can jump into a friend's car and escape it all for a moment. But for the 
meantime I continue to imagine a world where these words ring true for me,
and not just for some ideal other self I wish I had.

I feel that the final bridge sums the song's core up best with its lyrics:

> But I can't bring myself to\
> Hate me for wanting a break\
> I'll still be here in 5 years\
> Where I made every mistake\
> Sixteen trying to disappear\
> For one week and a half\
> You know it's all an act\
> 'Cause there's still a lot I haven't put into words yet

Ultimately, my mental state while just zoning out to this song can be summed up
in the following image:

### 1:15 

I have sung along to this song while miming out a little routine to the lyrics
many more times than I care to admit. It's not even that it's a song that I 
relate to! It's again similar to *Hangar* in being such a perfect encapsulation
of a feeling I wish I could relate to. Don't we all want to be an anime girl 
with a crush sometimes? Right? Not just me?

Well whichever way, this song's wonderful, upbeat feeling, extremely bright 
synths, and lyrics which I only know to describe as somewhat tsundere, are a 
wonderful little 2 minutes of music which continues on with 8485's incredible
ability to channel feelings into a little piece of music that almost anyone
can relate to, whether or not they've felt those things themselves.

### More to check out

I honestly haven't heard and 8485 song that I haven't liked. To be fair I also
haven't heard many 8485 songs. Whichever way, here are the ones I'd recommend
giving a listen off the top of my head.

(This is pretty much just a list of all the songs on *Plague Town* excluding 
*Hangar* because I gave that one its own section)

***Purgatory*** - A great little song to zone out to which seems to me to be 
another one of 8485's songs about relationships and/or suburbia.

***Seer*** - A song with extremely high vocals, and some sort of longing for
someone in what I can only assume is a romantic manner.

***Pure*** - Apparently this song is about a desire to be like christ, but as 
a lifelong athiest I can't really relate to that, so to me it's just a nice
little synthy song with some sort of longing lyrics.

***Southview*** - God I adore this breakup song. It does such a good job at 
capturing that feeling post-breakup when you don't know exactly what's going on 
and you're both giving each other space. This was one of my most listened to 
songs during my Big High School Breakupâ„¢.

tl;dr: Go listen to *Plague Town* if you like synthwave music and good singing
paired with great lyrics. Even if you don't still give it a listen! It's a 15 
minute long EP so you don't really have much to lose.

## 100 gecs

I'm writing this section as I'm riding the ferry home from the 100 gecs concert
in Vancouver! Or at least, I'm writing this sentence and the previous one
while on the way home. I'm eating poutine so I'm not gonna write a whole
section right now.

Alright, I finished my poutine and I've got a bit of time left before the 
ferry docks. 

100 gecs is probably the most famous artist that is definitively hyperpop in 
the world right now. Their first big hit, Money Machine, was a bit of a meme 
when it came out, but I didn't get into them until just after they released
their second album, *10000 gecs*, where most of my favourite songs of theirs 
are from. Approximately two weeks after hearing it, the opening song on the 
album, *Dumbest Girl Alive*, is my 16th most-listened to song so far this year.
I expect it to rise farther, and then probably fall a little when I get 
obsessed with another song sometime later this year.
