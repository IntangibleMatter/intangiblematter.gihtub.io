Thank you, to the ones who cared.

Thank you, to the ones who shaped me into who I am.

Thank you, to the ones that would talk to the weird kid about whatever I was
interested in at that point, whether or not they knew I struggled to make
friends.

Thank you, to the ones who I could have fascinating conversations with, whether
or not I learned much from their class itself.
