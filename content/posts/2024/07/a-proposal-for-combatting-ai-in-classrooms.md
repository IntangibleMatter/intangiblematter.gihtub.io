- Understand prompt engineering, so that you can mislead AIs

- other points it's like 6:15 am lmao


There are generally four broad categories of writers in a classroom today:

- Good writers who do the job honestly
- People who use AI but are good at it
- People who use AI but are bad at it
- Okay/Bad writers

The second group will at best blend in with the first and at worst blend in with
the last, *you cannot reliably weed them out without getting many more false
positives than actual AI users.*

The group to focus on is the third, then. They'd usually fall into the final
category without AI, and are going to be the easiest to weed out. This is not
done through online "AI detection" tools, however, as *there is no way of
reliably determining if a given text was writen by an AI.* Instead, focus on
engineering prompts and assignments in such a way that students should have no
difficulty understanding, but that a computer will easily get tripped up on if
given directly.

I saw a clever example of this on Twitter, where someone had an assignment for
their students to write a story about small forest creatures, but in the
instructions referenced Batman characters (such as The Joker, Robin, Catwoman,
and of course, Batman) so that any student who just input the instructions into
the AI would have a story that ended up including these characters. This is a
reasonable enough way to determine the most *obvious* AI users, but it, just
like *any other method of "AI detection"* is not fully reliable. A student
could've misread the assignment, or maybe they thought it would be funny to name
a squirrel "The Riddler" because it likes riddles, and as a nod to the
assignment's instructions themselves.

I need everyone reading this to understand: *you cannot identify whether text is
AI-generated objectively.* There is no way to tell. It's text, and as such there
are no signatures left behind aside from the manner of writing itself, which
itself is *designed to be a common but professional style of writing,* in other
words the way students are generally taught to write in an essay.
