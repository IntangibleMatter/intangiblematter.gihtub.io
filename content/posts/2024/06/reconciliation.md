Reconciliation is an interesting topic.

It's also an *incredibly* complicated one.

For any of you in the audience who aren't Canadian, Truth and Reconciliation is
an ongoing effort by the Government of Canada, and to varying degrees Canadian
citizens, to make amends for the horrors enacted upon the First Peoples of
Canada during colonization and the Residential School system. Its effectiveness
has been... varied, but overall it's doing the best work it can, considering
the circumstances.

That's all from my white-ass perspective, though, so take it with a heaping
pinch of salt.

I will say, though, that given my perspective is from my incredibly white ass,
I'd like to think it's better informed than a lot of other white-ass opinions
for a few reasons.

1. I spend a *lot* of time looking into the thoughts of minority groups so I
    can better understand their thoughts and needs, and act better as an ally.
2. My family's always had a rather close relationship with many indigenous
    people, and I've grown up hearing their thoughts.
3. Various subcomponents of the previous item.

I think that, from my experience at least, BC seems to have a rather unique
relationship with its indigenous population. We're the *only* province to
be composed primarily of unceded land, rather than territory that was stolen
*legally* through documents. This goes back to early Canadian history. While
the rest of the English territories overtook the land the indigenous peoples
lived on, the early settlers in British Columbia took an approach more akin
to the first French fort on the land, settling in places not already occupied
and doing trade with the indigenous population.[^1] At least, until eastern
Canada decided they didn't like this approach and forced the people living in BC
to start acting more like "*proper*" settlers. British Columbia would later have
the third highest count of Residential Schools in the country, with the only
higher counts being found in the prairies. BC is also home to the first nation
to regain self-governance, the Shíshálh nation. And even in the modern day,
though this could just be a byproduct of my slightly countercultural upbringing,
indigenous stories are well-known by many in BC. Hell, I could tell you the
story of how the Raven stole the Sun before I could tell you that I was
Canadian. It's not like they've been relegated to land acknowledgements like it
feels like they have been in some other places in Canada. This could all, of
course, be me buying into colonial narratives, but considering my sources for
the 'positives' are all from indigenous writings I've read over the years I'd
like to think that they're at least *fairly* accurate.

Let's get the obvious out of the way: in Canada the natives got *fucked*. From
the spread of terrible disease in the early days wiping out large portions of
the population to terrible land agreements to the *entire residential school
system* (something I *do not* have time to get into, but if you don't know what
it is, [wikipedia is always a good place to start](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Indian_residential_school_system).)
But tl;dr: about 100 years of "schools" that were centres for physical and
sexual abuse and had the goal of "taking the Indian out of the child". These
schools are now recognized as a form of cultural genocide.

So obviously we as a country need to make some form of amends, right? After all,
we stole their land, attempted (and largely succeeded in) erasing their
languages, suppressing their culture, and a billion other things. Though in our
defence we *did* introduce them to Poutine so... it's not *only* bad things?

The formal process of this in Canada started in 2008 with the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission (or TRC,) an organization with the purpose of
recognizing the impacts of the Residential School system on those who survived
it and their families, the history of the schools, and documenting it all.
Its other task was to

[^1]: At least, this is what I remember from various readings I've done. I know
it wasn't always like this, and that there were still issues, but from what
I've read (or at least *remember* reading) things were a little less... colonial
in BC than elsewhere in Canada, at least until people from out east came and
demanded an approach more like what they were doing.
