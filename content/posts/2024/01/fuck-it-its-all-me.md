For the past few months I've had my blog separated into two different pages:
`/posts/` and `/personal/`. Posts was where my more general, public-friendly
stuff would go, and personal is my archive for all my personal ramblings. But
you know what, fuck it. It's all me. Every post on here is me, whether it's a
personal rambling or it's a guide on how to do something in tech. It's all me.
If you just want one, you can go ahead and use the two links at the top to
filter your experience. But this site is me, so everything on it is me. I'm not
going to pretend like I'm partitioned off into differrent people.

Anyways hope you're well.
