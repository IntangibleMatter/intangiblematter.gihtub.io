Having graduated high school in June of this year, I've realized that I was,
without a doubt, the "weird kid" of my grade. That's not to say that I was
hated, or that I was actively ostracized (though if I was I didn't notice),
but I was definitively an "outsider" through most of school. I had (and have) my
friends, my fans, and my allies, but there was a consistent "otherness" that I
carried with me. (Though upon some level of reflection I'm uncertain as to how
much was imposed from outside and how much was my own rejection of people before
I could be rejected myself.)

Locvis is a fictional town with a fictional high school named after it, serving
as the location of much of the story of a tv show a former collaborator and
friend of mine worked on through early high school, based loosely on our own
experiences and people in our lives. In the interest of privacy, I've elected to
use pseudonyms in a manner similar to the show for this piece of writing.

Lastly, why monologues? Because that's how I kept myself sane for the last few
years. All of the hardships, all of the people around me, I would draft
monologues of varying tone and length which I would recite to them in my head,
making myself seem very engaging and sympathetic. And while I didn't always look
like the *good* guy coming out of them, I would at least be a villain Tumblr
users would cream themselves over.

Without further ado, a selection\
of ***The Locvis Monologues.***

I still remember when we met, you know?\
I'd just arrived to school. No friends, no experience. I got put at a desk to
play some sort of math game with you. We got along well, or at least well
enough. You seemed to have so many friends, so many people that orbited around
you
