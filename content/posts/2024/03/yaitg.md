If you're wondering what the title stands for, it's *Yet Another Update From*
*Yet Another Internet Trans Girl*, and this post is exactly what it says on the
tin.

I have some [posts about]({{< ref "/content/posts/2023/03/eggs-and-gender.md" >}})
[my previous]({{< ref "/content/posts/2023/04/youve-cracked-your-egg-now-fry-in-it.md" >}})
[gender questioning]({{< ref "/content/posts/2023/05/eggs-like-russian-dolls.md" >}})
on this page, so it's not anything new. But tl;dr for anyone who hasn't read the
previous posts: I'm gender questioning, fit a lot of tropes for transfems, spend
a *ton* of time thinking about what it would be like to be a girl, wishing I was
a girl, knowing that girls (especially trans ones) have a lot harder time
moving through life than cis guys do, but still feeling like it would be easier,
etc, etc, etc.

After a long day, I'll cuddle my Blu haj, play some Celeste (or program), listen
to some Underscores or Femtanyl, sometimes *wear a fucking Celeste Skirt*,
browse trans subreddits, and look at the trans flag on my wall. I will do *all*
of this, then have the *gall* to say "Still cis tho."
