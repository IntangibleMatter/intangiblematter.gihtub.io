If you're wondering what the title stands for, it's *Yet Another Update From*
*Yet Another Internet Trans Girl*, and this post is exactly what it says on the
tin.

I have some [posts about]({{< ref "posts/2023/03/eggs-and-gender.md" >}})
[my previous]({{< ref "posts/2023/04/youve-cracked-your-egg-now-fry-in-it.md" >}})
[gender questioning]({{< ref "posts/2023/05/eggs-like-russian-dolls.md" >}})
on this page, so it's not anything new. But tl;dr for anyone who hasn't read the
previous posts: I'm gender questioning, fit a lot of tropes for transfems, spend
a *ton* of time thinking about what it would be like to be a girl, wishing I was
a girl, knowing that girls (especially trans ones) have a lot harder time
moving through life than cis guys do, but still feeling like it would be easier,
etc, etc, etc.

After a long day, I'll cuddle my Blåhaj, play some Celeste (or program), listen
to some Underscores or Femtanyl, sometimes *wear a fucking Celeste Skirt*,
browse trans subreddits, and look at the trans flag on my wall. I will do *all*
of this, then have the *gall* to say "Still cis tho."

Point is I'm barely holding on to being cis. I think I'm just scared not to be
because of two reasons:

1. I don't like not being certain of things
2. Holy shit society hates trans people right now this is terrifying.

So y'know... not necessarily the *best* position to be questioning my gender in,
even if I'm in a relatively safe place with a supportive family. It's... I'm not
sure how to say it.

I've been questioning since I was 12 (at *least*), but lately it's all just
been... harder to ignore. Some of it was internal, but over the last year some
other stuff happened that also has made thinking about my gender... *much*
harder to avoid.

First was my first major breakup. No, I will not be talking about it in detail.
I wasn't avoiding questioning because they would judge me (my ex is, themselves,
Gender Non-Conforming), but because I was being a stupid emotionally distant
little 17 year old shit like so many teenage boys are.

Second has just been uncovering... how *much* of myself strongly associated with
trans culture in so many ways. This is a meme I posted in April of last year.
![A meme with a dog awkwardly trying to blend in with ducks. The ducks are labelled 'trans people', and the dog is labelled 'me, a cis guy, here for the suspiciously relatable memes. The water they are all in is labelled r/egg_irl'](/media/2024/03/cisguyrelatable.webp)
{{< caption "still cis tho" >}}

Here's an abridged list of other trans-associated things I associate with:

- Celeste
- Blåhaj
- Hyperpop
    - 100 Gecs
    - underscores
    - femtanyl
- constantly thinking about what it would be like to be the other gender
- mostly having friends not of my AGAB
- being "just a really passionate ally"
    - passionate enough to have a trans flag on the wall

Again, *far* from a complete list. Barely scraping the surface here. I'm tired
and writing later than I should be.
