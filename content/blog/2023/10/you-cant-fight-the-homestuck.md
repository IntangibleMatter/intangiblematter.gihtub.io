In August of this year I started reading one of the most infamous webcomics,
parts of internet culture, and just general clusterfucks out there. Which
is to say that I started reading Homestuck.

[Homestuck](https://homestuck.com), for those who don't know, is/was a webcomic
about four kids who play a game that results in the end of the world, and their
efforts to create a new one. That's the short version of it, and it also mentions
nothing of the numerous flashes, incredible music, odd spin-offs and sidequests,
its nature as a borderline cult, much to the distress of the creator, and all of
the other chaos. This isn't going to be a post explaining Homesetuck, if you want
to know about that, I recommend giving [Sarah Z's excellent video on the history of Homestuck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohFyOjfcLWQ)
a watch. It also goes into some of the chaos the fandom and the like. Thankfully
I missed the whole fandom boat, but I honestly think that's for the better. I
can be prone to getting caught up in fandom, as evidenced by my past as
[one of the heads of the r/place Celeste team](https://www.reddit.com/r/celestegame/comments/ttj1i7/i_made_a_drawing_for_the_rplace_plan_due_to_the/), the [meme lord of r/scottthewoz,](https://www.reddit.com/r/scottthewoz/comments/bii7aa/my_favourite_of_my_new_three_formats_33/)
and many other things that I've put out of my mind in the time since.
