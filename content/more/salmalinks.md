So because it would be hard to write them all down on paper, I decided to make
a little hidden page on my site to add some of the links and the like I wanted
to share with you! Hope you enjoy :)

I immediately thought of you when I saw this, how could I not?

[El Goonish Shive](https://www.egscomics.com/), a webcomic that I binged a few
months back that has all sorts of cool stuff with magic, transformations, and
transformation magic. I recommend starting at the birthday party arc, seems to
be when the comic really kinda sorts out what it is and what it wants to do.

I feel like there were more things than this... Ah well, I'm sure I'll remember
well after you've seen this. Enjoy!
