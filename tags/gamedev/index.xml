meetup! I basically got on a bus &lt;em>right&lt;/em> after school to get down to the ferry,
then I went into Vancouer and&amp;hellip; ate food?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also all of this was with my friend &lt;a href="https://visu.do">River&lt;/a>. They&amp;rsquo;re cool.
Check them out. Without whom I probably would&amp;rsquo;ve been having an anxiety attack
for the whole trip so&amp;hellip; thanks, Riv!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Footpedal: A FOSS Audio Engine for Games</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/05/12/footpedal-a-foss-audio-engine-for-games/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 May 2023 10:01:10 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/05/12/footpedal-a-foss-audio-engine-for-games/</guid><description>&lt;p>I &lt;em>love&lt;/em> dynamic audio in games. Being a game developer, I want to add it to my
own projects. Unfortunately, I&amp;rsquo;m broke and all existing solutions are expensive
to use (at least without a giant splash screen when you boot up the game.)
Obviously, being a programmer myself, I decided I&amp;rsquo;d try to write an audio
engine on my own. This is, of course, a completely giant task, and I am not
amazing at programming complex systems, especially at lower levels, so I
pretty much gave up. Before I gave up, though, I mentioned this project to a
friend of mine, &lt;a href="https://visu.do">River&lt;/a>, who promptly didn&amp;rsquo;t quite get it
and continued &lt;em>rewriting the JVM&lt;/em>. A few weeks back, though, they ended up
taking another look at the project, and we started working on it together.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Game Engines [ARCHIVE]</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2021/07/12/game-engines-archive/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2021 10:01:29 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2021/07/12/game-engines-archive/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>PLEASE NOTE: this is an archive from my original blog.
