      <description>Katana ZERO, for those of you who don&amp;rsquo;t know, is a 2019 video game created by Justin Standard (aka Askiisoft) and a few others. It features difficult side-scrolling action, tight combat, an amazing soundtrack, beautiful pixel art, and one of my favourite stories of the past decade. While I could rave about it for hours, I&amp;rsquo;ll do my best to keep this article finite.&#xA;Also, in case it wasn&amp;rsquo;t obvious, there will be MAJOR SPOILERS for Katana ZERO!</description>

      <description>Wandersong is a very special game. Ask almost anyone who&amp;rsquo;s played it, and you&amp;rsquo;ll find them at the very least agreeing enthusiastically, and more than likely raving about some moment in the game or another. In addition to this, the creator says there&amp;rsquo;s almost as many pieces of fanart as copies of the game sold. Which is, to put it lightly, incredible. But I&amp;rsquo;m not here today to talk about how beloved this game is.</description>

      <description>In case you couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell by the fact that I make games and have spent the majority of the money I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten as a teenager on Steam gift cards, I&amp;rsquo;m a bit of a fan of the medium of video games.&#xA;The Beginner&amp;rsquo;s Guide Everybody feels like shit sometimes.&#xA;Everybody makes mistakes.&#xA;Not everybody makes a game which conveys these feelings so effectively and in a way that feels so painfully accurate to how it feels to have hurt somebody in a way you can&amp;rsquo;t take back.</description>
