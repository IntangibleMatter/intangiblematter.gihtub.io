Might be good to listen to with this post. Idk.
You know how some people feel like they&amp;rsquo;re the only real person in the world?
I have the opposite problem.
To some degree.:w
Society paints a very strong picture in our minds of what a &amp;ldquo;teenager&amp;rdquo; is supposed to do. And I very rarely find myself meeting those expectations. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s because of my anxiety, depression, or just general tendencies to isolate myself socially (lockdown was a bit of a dream come true), I tend to find myself working on my computer, browsing the internet, and just being alone with my (admittedly distressing) thoughts.</description></item><item><title>Impostor Syndrome, Adhd, and Burgers</title><link>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/05/31/impostor-syndrome-adhd-and-burgers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 May 2023 12:24:11 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://intangiblematter.github.io/posts/2023/05/31/impostor-syndrome-adhd-and-burgers/</guid><description>So this is just a short little update.

I&amp;rsquo;ve had ideas for various projects about my mental health for a few years now. This is the first project of this vein that I&amp;rsquo;ve completed, and it almost definitely won&amp;rsquo;t be the last. This film features me and three representations of various aspects of my mental health while anxiety screams over me, depression mopes while resting its head on the heater, and my own expectations of myself frantically justify why they exist by the mirror.</description></item></channel></rss>
