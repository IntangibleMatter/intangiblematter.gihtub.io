The snow on the road outside my house is currently about 15cm deep at least and shows no signs of slowing down. I wake up, look out my window and assume they&amp;rsquo;ve declared a snow day. Checking my school&amp;rsquo;s app, however, tells me a different story.
Dear [my school district] Learning Community:
All [my school district] schools will have a DELAYED START today, Tuesday, February 28, 2023, due to inclement weather.</description></item></channel></rss>
