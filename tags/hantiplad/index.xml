I had a long time where I mostly listened to video game music, then a good few months where I mostly listened to electro. (Thanks, Just Shapes and Beats!) Recently, though, I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to hyperpop. For those of you who don&amp;rsquo;t know, hyperpop is a musical genre which can be loosely defined as a type of music that borrows strongly from pop for its layout, early 2000s internet for its musical aesthetics, and pretty much whatever the hell the artist feels like for the lyrics.</description></item></channel></rss>
