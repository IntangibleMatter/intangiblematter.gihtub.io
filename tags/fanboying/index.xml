It&amp;rsquo;s
honestly &lt;em>even better&lt;/em> than everyone says. The effects were &lt;em>amazing&lt;/em>, the
writing was &lt;em>fantastic&lt;/em>, and the actors were all&amp;hellip; *&lt;em>chef&amp;rsquo;s kiss&lt;/em>*.&lt;/p>

&lt;p class="caption">Our deadpan-hyper chaotic-evil queen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My favourite character was &lt;em>easily&lt;/em> Jobu Tupekai. She&amp;rsquo;s honestly everything I
aspire to be. A cool, nihilistic, reality warping, amazing looking young adult
who created an object that can destroy the most powerful people somewhat out
of &lt;em>boredom&lt;/em>. She even &lt;em>moves&lt;/em> how I want to. Just a little bit crazy, and like
a cutesy cartoon character was given a few doses of evil maniac. People who
move in an animated way are the &lt;em>best&lt;/em>. And the head ticking to swap between
dimensions&amp;hellip; UGH! It&amp;rsquo;s a brilliant film, and I loved all the characters.
Waymond was adorable and we all need someone like him in our lives, Evelyn was
&lt;em>such&lt;/em> a compelling character, and it was all.. ugh. &lt;em>so amazing&lt;/em>!!!1!1&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
